#### Git
- Version history for code
- download: git-scm.com/downloads
- Remember that "git add" doesn't actually create a new version it just lets us pick which changes we want in the next version.
- So to create a new version we're going to use another git command which is "git commit -m"
- **version = commit**
- **Why we create versions in git manually? Why is it not done automatically as in the case of google docs?**
- **Ans. The problem with codes is that untill you finish your code it probably doesn't work so we don't really want to be automatically creating versions of our code that doesn't work. For google docs it doesn't really matter if the thing's finished or not, it's just a bunch of words and sentences. So you're not going to get errors from a half finished document. That's not the same with half finished code. So that's why we always create versions manually with git we want to make sure that a code is good to go before we put it in our version history.
